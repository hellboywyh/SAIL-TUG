# SAIL-TUG

## Overview
Timed-Up and Go video for SAIL(SAIL-TUG) is a new medical gait data set, focus on abnormal gait detection of person. Following are the detailed descriptions.

* Volume  
The dataset contains 404 TUG videos. By downsampling, 38,098 images is annotated with 2D human poses with 16 pixel-wise key points.  
* Diversity  
The 404 TUG videos are recored in several different places including hospitals, communities and nursing homes. And the gait of the subjects also varied widely.
